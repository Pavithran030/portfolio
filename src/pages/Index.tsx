    longDesc: `Syncwork is a real-time collaborative task management application designed for small teams who need to stay in sync without the overhead of complex project management tools.

  The application follows a Kanban-style workflow where tasks move through three stages — To Do, In Progress, and Done. Teams create a shared board, distribute a unique join code to teammates, and from that point everyone works on the same board simultaneously. When one person creates a card, moves it to a different column, or updates its details, every other connected user sees the change instantly without refreshing the page.

  Built entirely on the frontend using React 18, TypeScript, and Vite, Syncwork uses Supabase as its complete backend — handling authentication, database storage, real-time event broadcasting, and row-level security all in one platform. There is no custom server to maintain or deploy. The entire application is hosted on Vercel as a static site, making it fast, free to run, and easy to deploy.

  The real-time layer is powered by Supabase Realtime, which listens to database changes and pushes them to all connected clients through WebSocket channels. User presence — showing who is currently viewing the board — is handled through Supabase's Presence feature, displaying live avatars at the top of the board. A live activity feed on the sidebar records every action taken by the team, updating in real time as work happens.

  Cards support titles, descriptions, assignees, and deadlines. Cards approaching their deadline are visually highlighted to draw attention. Drag and drop is supported on both desktop and mobile, allowing cards to be moved between columns with a natural gesture.

  The interface uses a distinctive Handwritten Notebook theme — warm cream and parchment backgrounds, Lora serif typography, ruled-line card borders, and ink-colored column headers — giving the application a focused, paper-like feel that stands apart from generic SaaS tools.

  Authentication is handled entirely by Supabase Auth, including registration, login, forgot password, and reset password flows. All data is protected by PostgreSQL Row Level Security policies, ensuring users can only access boards they belong to.`,
